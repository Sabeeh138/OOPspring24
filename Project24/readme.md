## This project is a hospital management system.

## project proposal:
<p>the idea was to create a program that can cater to the needs of both management staff and the people coming to the<br>
   airport. A layer of security is to be added to ensure a normal user cant access the admin panel and the data in the<br>
   file cant be manually changed. In addition to that data recycling functionality was to be added so that any and all<br>
   records deleted are stored in another recycled file and that data could be deleted later on. Attractive prompt<br>
   messages to be displayed to make the interface more user friendly and should have enough data manipulation options for<br>
   the management. Hospital Management System (HMS) is a software solution designed to streamline and automate the administrative <br>
   and operational processes within a hospital or healthcare facility. This proposal outlines the key features, objectives, and <br>
   implementation plan for developing an HMS.</p>
